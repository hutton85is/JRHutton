  <div class="about">
    <p>I'm a Mechatronics engineer with a great passion for programming. In my spare time I like to create small projects using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I finished a B.Sc degree in Mechatronics in 2016 at the University of Reykjavik. After my B.Sc degree I enrolled in Computer Science to further increase my knowledge in software development and agile practices. </p>
    <p>The purpose of this webpage is to share my projects with people interested. I mainly code in C or C++ and when I do Arduino projects I use <a class="link" href="https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7" target="_blank">Atmel Studio</a>. I hope this webpage and my projects will help you gain an understanding programming Arduino in C. If you for some reason want to contact me this is my e-mail: <a class="email" href="mailto:hutton85is@yahoo.com">hutton85is@yahoo.com</a></p>
