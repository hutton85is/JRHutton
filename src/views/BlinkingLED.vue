    <h1>Blinking LED</h1>
    The blinking LED is a simple project to demonstrate how to use the output pin.
    The purpose is to blink an LED every 500ms. We will do this using both a delay and the timer - compare registers.

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Arduino Uno r3</li>
    <li>A basic LED</li>
    <li>220<span>&#8486;</span> resistor</li>
    <li>two jumper wires and a breadboard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup and Code</h2>
    We will be using pin 2 as output on the Arduino. Hookup LED ground pin to ground on the Arduino and the other end to pin 2 of the Arduino.<p/>
